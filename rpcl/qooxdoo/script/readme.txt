Quick start
===========

It is easy to get started with qooxdoo. For detailed information please
see http://qooxdoo.org/documentation/1.1#getting_started

For the impatient, here is a short version:

Use the 'tool/bin/create-application.py' script to setup a new application.
This will create a minimal directory structure of an application, which is ready to
be built and run. Within the newly created application folder run the command
'generate.py source-all' to build a development version of your app.
Open 'source/index.html' in your browser and see your first application in action. You can
then go on and extend it into an application of your liking by changing the
'Application.js' class file below the 'source/class/' folder.


API Reference
=============

You might also want to open the API viewer in a separate browser window,
which offers the qooxdoo framework API in a convenient way (See the
top-level 'index.html' file next to this readme.txt).
